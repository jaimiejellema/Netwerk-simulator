This software was created while working on my bachelor

A server application emulates a peer to peer network, while in reality it's client-server.

First message client is unique identifier (currently just numbers 1,2,3,4, etc.
This message is used by server to map network connections to clients.

After this the peer to peer discovery and connection protocols start.
All routing will be link state routing, due to the small size of the network.

Routing is two step process.
Pings to determine connectivty
Broadcast connectivity data to all nodes in network
Use connectivity data to route application packets
It uses a variantion/partial implementation of TCP for reliable data transfer
